# Salesforce Expense Tracking System

A modern expense management system built on Salesforce that uses Google's Document AI to automatically process receipts. Simply upload a receipt and the AI extracts merchant details, transaction date, line items, and totals to create a complete expense record. The native Salesforce platform enables powerful reporting and analytics through custom dashboards and reports to track spending patterns, monitor budgets, and streamline expense management workflows.
